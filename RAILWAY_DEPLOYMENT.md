# 🚀 RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT FIX

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED!**

The deployment failed because Railway was trying to deploy from the root directory. I've fixed this by:

1. ✅ **Created `railway.json` in root** - Tells Railway to use backend directory
2. ✅ **Created `nixpacks.toml`** - Specifies Python setup and backend directory
3. ✅ **Removed conflicting `frontend/railway.json`** - Prevents confusion

## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS:**

### **1. Redeploy on Railway (2 minutes)**
1. Go back to your Railway dashboard
2. Click **"Redeploy"** button
3. Railway will now use the correct configuration
4. Wait for deployment to complete

### **2. Get Your Backend URL**
- After successful deployment, copy the Railway URL
- It will look like: `https://sudarshanchakraai-production.up.railway.app`

### **3. Deploy Frontend to Vercel**
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
4. Set **Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = your Railway URL
5. Deploy

## 🎯 **ALTERNATIVE: Use Render.com (Easier)**

If Railway still has issues, use Render.com instead:

### **Backend on Render:**
1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com)
2. Create **Web Service**
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Set **Root Directory** to `backend`
5. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. **Start Command**: `python main.py`
7. Deploy

### **Frontend on Render:**
1. Create **Static Site**
2. Connect same GitHub repo
3. Set **Root Directory** to `frontend`
4. **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
5. **Publish Directory**: `out`
6. Deploy

## 🏆 **QUICK FIX COMMANDS:**

```bash
# If you want to test locally first:
cd backend
python main.py

# Then deploy to Railway with the new config
# The deployment should work now!
```

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT:**

After redeploying, you should see:
- ✅ **Build successful**
- ✅ **Backend running on Railway**
- ✅ **Health check passing**
- ✅ **Ready for frontend deployment**

**Your project will be live and ready for the hackathon!** 🚀✨
